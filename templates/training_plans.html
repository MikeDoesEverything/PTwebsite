          <h1>Why choose me?</h1>
          <p>
            What separates me from other Personal Trainers? I am the most qualified
            personal trainer in the area. With my bachelorâ€™s degree in Sports
            Science, level 4 in strength and conditioning and level 3 in
            personal training and my other numerous qualifications, there is
            no competition. And even more importantly, I am still building
            upon my knowledge and skills in order to provide you with the best
            service. In my experience personal training, I have worked with
            clients of all shapes sizes and skill levels. Some of my clients
            were obese, some were anorexic, some worked in the military, some
            were elite, world class athletes, some were bodybuilders and some
            spent too much time behind a desk and just wanted some exercise.
            Whatever your goals, I can help you achieve them.
