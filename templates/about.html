                <h2>Why choose me?</h2>
                <p>
                  What separates me from other Personal Trainers? I am the most qualified
                  personal trainer in the area. With my bachelor’s degree in Sports
                  Science, level 4 in strength and conditioning and level 3 in
                  personal training and my other numerous qualifications, there is
                  no competition. And even more importantly, I am still building
                  upon my knowledge and skills in order to provide you with the best
                  service. In my experience personal training, I have worked with
                  clients of all shapes sizes and skill levels. Some of my clients
                  were obese, some were anorexic, some worked in the military, some
                  were elite, world class athletes, some were bodybuilders and some
                  spent too much time behind a desk and just wanted some exercise.
                  Whatever your goals, I can help you achieve them.
