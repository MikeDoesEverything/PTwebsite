              <p>
                What separates me from other Personal Trainers? I am the most qualified
                personal trainer in the area. With my bachelorâ€™s degree in Sports
                Science, level 4 in strength and conditioning and level 3 in
                personal training and my other numerous qualifications, there is
                no competition. And even more importantly, I am still building
                upon my knowledge and skills in order to provide you with the best
                service. In my experience personal training, I have worked with
                clients of all shapes sizes and skill levels. Some of my clients
                were obese, some were anorexic, some worked in the military, some
                were elite, world class athletes, some were bodybuilders and some
                spent too much time behind a desk and just wanted some exercise.
                Whatever your goals, I can help you achieve them.
